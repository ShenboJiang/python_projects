# This code is intended to see whether or not the level of champions in League of Legends can be approximated by other game features.
# The code file down below includes a supervised model that conveys this idea by utilising certain game 
# festures from data set provided to make predictions on in-game levels.

# LOL_ML.ipynb is the source code file with the supervised model and graphing function included.
# README (this file) is the introduction and instruction for the source code file.


# Instructins:
#1. Open the project2.ipynb file.
#2. Run All
#3. Check the output if needed.
